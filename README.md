# NTP-Clock
## As the name suggests this is a clock with NTP server. It is based on ESP-32 platform and programmed in micropython. 
### For display I used four 8x8 LED matrix drived by MAX7219 and the RTC is DS3231.

The device is programmed with micropython, uses four 8x8 LED matrixes, DS3231 and have automatic display dimming controlled by a light sensitivity sensor made with photoresistor and built-in ADC.
